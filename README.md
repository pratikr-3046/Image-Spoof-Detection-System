# Image-Spoof-Detection-System
This project implements a multi-stage image spoof detection system that integrates various detection techniques including deepfake detection, 3D mask spoofing detection, and 2D image forgery detection. The system is built with separate modules for each detection technique and integrated into a full pipeline.
